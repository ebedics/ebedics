## Part 2: Data Storage
Below are my thoughts about the OpenDataPhilly dataset, Neighborhood Food Retail

<details>
<summary>Neighborhood Food Retail Dataset</summary>
1. Why do I find this dataset interesting?
  I initially clicked into the OpenDataPhilly dataset purely because I live in Philly and I was curious to see what data was available to the public. The archived dataset about Philadelphia Food Access caught my eye, which brought me to the up to date version of the data set, Neighborhood Food Retail. Food Access in Philadelphia is a prevalent topic and one I have thought a lot about. Just from my own experience in my neighborhood, the only walkable store for food used to be a Family Dollar (no fresh produce). Then, they opened a Sprouts, which is an extremely inaccessible store for many because of the prices. I have heard similar stories about access in many other areas as well. 
2. What information is contained in the metadata of the dataset you selected? What additional information would be useful to include in the metadata?
  There is a good amount of information contained in the metadata. OpenDataPhilly has a metadata catalog that gives the public access to see the metadata for all the datasets that are listed on the site. The metadata given are name, department responsible for the data, dataset contact, description, development process of the dataset, date range of the dataset, coordinate system, format, table/layer name, whether or not it contains sensitive data, and when the metadata was last updated. It also gives fields of data that were used in forming the dataset, gives datasets that are other versions or subsets of the Neighborhood Food Retail Dataset, reference files, reports or websites that provide additional info about the dataset, and endpoints. It is slightly confusing because there is a Neighborhood Food Retail and Access dataset and a Neigborhood Food Retail Dataset, so the only recommendation I have would be to combine them or have a different naming convention. 
  
3. How can the dataset be accessed? Are there any barriers to accessing the data?
  The dataset can be accessed as visualizations created using HTML, and then in downloadable file formats CSV, SHP, GeoJSON, and API. I think they make it pretty accessible because of the visualization tool, which can just be opened in another tab and doesn't require you to download any content. If they didn't have the CSV version, I would say it would be inaccessible to access the raw data but I don't think that's the case.

## Part 3: Navigating GitHub Search
<details>
<summary>Topic Links</summary>
  
  
The two topics I chose were [metadata](https://github.com/topics/metadata) and [web archiving](https://github.com/topics/web-archiving). 

One of the repositories within the metadata topic that I starred was called OpenMetadata, which looks to be some type of standardization tool for metadata. The repository contains descriptions about the features and functions included in OpenMetadata, a demo, documentation, and contributors. They have an open source code that is included as well as known issues.

The other repository I starred is called ArchiveBox, which labels itself as an open source self-hosted web archiving. It has a pretty large following and is really interesting in just the world of personal internet archiving.
