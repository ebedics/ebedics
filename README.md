| Hobby | Description |

|Gardening| I co-founded a community garden in Philadelphia. Check out my libguide on Community Gardening in Philly [here](https://drexellis.libguides.com/phillycommunitygardening)!|
|Weightlifting|I have done competitive weightlifting in the past but it is currently just a hobby I continue|
|Reading| Not surprising given my chosen Master's program. My favorite genre is Fantasy but I'll read almost anything       |
|Being outside| This doesn't feel like a hobby but so many hobbies are encompassed in it. I love traveling and my goal is to visit every U.S. National Park before I'm 30. I enjoy camping, hiking, and kayaking as well. |
